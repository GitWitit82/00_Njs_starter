   - ⚠️ Response workflow missing
   - ⚠️ Response attachments not implemented

### Project Management
1. Project Creation
   - ✅ Basic project structure
   - ⚠️ Project template system incomplete
   - ⚠️ Project cloning not implemented

2. Task Management
   - ✅ Basic task creation and assignment
   - ⚠️ Task dependencies need improvement
   - ⚠️ Task scheduling needs optimization

## Known Issues

### Form Builder Issues
1. Component Loading
   \`\`\`
   Error: FormPreview component not found in page.tsx
   Solution: Need to import FormPreview component
   \`\`\`

2. Type Definitions
   \`\`\`
   Error: Missing type definitions for form template schema
   Solution: Create proper TypeScript interfaces for form schemas
   \`\`\`

3. State Management
   \`\`\`
   Error: Form state not persisting between tabs
   Solution: Implement proper state management system
   \`\`\`

4. Validation
   \`\`\`
   Error: Form validation not handling all edge cases
   Solution: Enhance validation system with comprehensive rules
   \`\`\`

### API Issues
1. Error Handling
   \`\`\`
   Error: Inconsistent error responses from API endpoints
   Solution: Standardize error handling across all API routes
   \`\`\`

2. Type Safety
   \`\`\`
   Error: API routes missing proper type checking
   Solution: Add request/response type validation
   \`\`\`

### UI/UX Issues
1. Responsiveness
   \`\`\`
   Issue: Form builder not fully responsive on mobile devices
   Solution: Enhance mobile layout and touch interactions
   \`\`\`

2. Performance
   \`\`\`
   Issue: Large forms causing performance issues
   Solution: Implement virtualization for large form lists
   \`\`\`

## Required Dependencies

### NPM Packages to Add
\`\`\`json
{
  "@hello-pangea/dnd": "latest",
  "zod": "latest",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "latest",
  "react-hook-form": "latest"
}
\`\`\`

### Missing Type Definitions
\`\`\`typescript
// Need to create these type definition files
types/form-template.d.ts
types/form-response.d.ts
types/custom-field.d.ts
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

### Critical Fixes
1. Resolve component import issues
2. Add missing type definitions
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add form validation system

### Feature Completion
1. Complete dynamic form functionality
2. Implement template versioning
3. Add response workflow
4. Enhance project management features

### Optimization
1. Improve form builder performance
2. Enhance mobile responsiveness
3. Optimize state management
4. Add proper loading states

## Migration Guide

To resolve these issues in a new composer, the following information will be needed:

1. Current schema structure
2. Implemented API routes
3. Component hierarchy
4. Type definitions
5. State management approach
6. Validation rules
7. Error handling patterns

This information should be used to create a focused debugging session that addresses each issue systematically.
